### Description
This repo is dedicated to my love of fantasy sports!  This is going to contain my source code
for predicting player performance.  The goal is to provide daily lineups that are most likely
to win a person money in fanduel daily fantasy contests.  More to come.

### Steps
1. daily_data_transform.py is how I will transform the incoming csv data file every day.
The data needs to be transformed so that I can make predictions with it.

2. train_model.py is the file I will use to train the model. the model will be retrained
and reevaluated weekly.

3. predict_scores.py is the file I will use to predict the fanduel scores for that day

### Other
data_modeling_pt1.py is my initial exploration of the models
